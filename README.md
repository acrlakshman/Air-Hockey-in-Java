Note regarding licence
======================
This simple game was written during a hackathon event conducted by The Hub at UWMadison (CS department). This was written along with
2 other CS students. We didn't get introduced to each other, so I don't know their names to include in licence file. However, I would
like to note that we all have equal contribution to this code.
